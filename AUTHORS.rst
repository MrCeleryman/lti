This project is the iterative work of several people,
under several different project names.

The (((maintainer))) of this fork is:

* Nicholas Achilles `@captainachilles`_

CaptainAchilles forked this project from the better maintained project: `lti`:

* Ryan Hiebert `@ryanhiebert`_
* Jay Luker `@lbjay`_

.. _`@ryanhiebert`: https://github.com/ryanhiebert
.. _`@lbjay`: https://github.com/lbjay


The project originally started life as ``ims_lti_py``.
Then Jay Luker moved the project to ``dce_lti_py``,
which was later brought under the mantle of
the Python LTI Initiative with the name ``lti``.

The core contributors to the original ``ims_lti_py`` are:

* Anson MacKeracher `@amackera`_
* Jero Sutlovic `@jsutlovic`_
